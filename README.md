If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itsell, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works"

97.  "What Made the Three Wise Men Wise?

In Sunday School, I learned an important life’s lesson. It was a lesson from of the three Wise Men.

My Sunday school teacher was a great teacher. She was young, pretty, and loved teaching kids. During one class, she asked us: “What made the three wise men wise?”

Naturally, I said, “They had money. They came bearing expensive gifts. They were rich and wise men.”

Obviously, that was not the answer she was looking for. After a few other students attempted their answers, she smiled and said: “What made them wise was their life-long search for great teachers.”

Pausing for a moment to let that thought sink in, into the minds of kids below the age of 12, she continued by saying: “They were wise men, rich men, because they never stopped learning. They kept seeking new knowledge, knowledge from great teachers.”"
